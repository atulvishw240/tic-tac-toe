## My Learnings

I learned and implemented the Object Oriented Principles. I had trouble understanding whether to put some method into **Board** class or **Player** class. I tried my best to show as little interfaces as possible as I read in [this article](https://eriktrautman.com/posts/ruby-explained-inheritance-and-scope).
